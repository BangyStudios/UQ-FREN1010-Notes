# Notes

## Pronunciation Rules
- The last symbol is pronounced stronger.
- **e** at the end and when surrounded by consonants is usually silent. 
- If there are more than 2 **e**s before a consonant, then pronounce the **e**, i.e., **appellerai**: Here, you pronounce the **e** in **"elle"** because there are three **e** before the consonant.
- If a vowel is followed by a consonant, then it must be pronounced, i.e., _le_, _autrement_.
- The final consonant is silent; the final **e** is also silent.
- When a word is borrowed from English, pronounce the last consonant, i.e., _bus_.
### Closed Vowels
- When a vowel is followed by 2 consonants, it's pronounced normally (open the mouth).
- When the **e** is followed by 2 **m**s, it's pronounced like an **a**, i.e., _évidemment_.
### Additional Pronunciation Notes
- **Final "e"** is generally silent unless it is at the start of a phrase or when surrounded by two consonants, as in _autrement_ or _mercredi_.
- **Final consonants** are generally silent in French. For example, in _tasse_, _livre_, or _valise_, the final consonant is not pronounced.
### Oral Vowels

- For the vowel **[Y]** as in _tu_, practice the pronunciation using [this resource](https://www.francepodcasts.com/2020/10/06/le-son-u-y/).
- For vowel groups like **OU** [u] and **OI** [wa], refer to [this page](https://www.francepodcasts.com/phonetique/).
## Basic Conversations
### Greetings
- _Ça va_ means "how are you?" and also "good," depending on intonation. Going down is asking, going up is replying.
- Never use _madame_ followed by a first name.
### Tu/Vous
- _Vous_ is formal, and _tu_ is informal.
- _Tu_ is usually used by an adult talking to a child or to their pets.
### Introducing Yourself and Others
- Use the verb **s’appeler** when giving or asking a name, which literally means "to call oneself."
- Example: _Je m’appelle..._ (My name is...) or _Comment t’appelles-tu?_ (What is your name?).
### Tonic Pronouns
- **Moi**, **Toi**, **Lui**, **Elle**, **Nous**, **Vous**, **Eux**, **Elles** are used for emphasis.
- Example: _Moi, je m’appelle..._ (I, I am called...).
